The scheduler was a Little tough for me.Styling and css was a little hard for me.
My name is Michael I am a first year coder. 
The one thing i could not do was manage to get the save button to stay where it was.
otherwise the functions work.

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
